###1. Which graph-related tasks does an ideal GitHub Network Graph need to address?

Low-level tasks:
- sort: temporal or sequential
- retrieve value of a particular commit: when it occurred and what the commit was
- filter: by date, by branch

Topology-based task:
- connectivity: it is important to get an overview of the connectivity of the commits to get a sense of the branching and forking of a particular repository.

Browsing task:
- follow path: from a particular node, we might want to follow a particular branch to see the sequence of commits
- revisit: we might want to return to a particular node to follow a different branching off
